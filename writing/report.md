# Report

## Application and Neural Network Structure (to be completed by 4pm on January 21st)

### Application and Prediction Task

TODO: Describe your chosen application and the specific prediction task. Explain why you chose this task and its relevance.

### Input Features

TODO: Identify and explain at least three input features relevant to your application.

### Dataset

TODO: Describe your dataset. Include details such as the number of data points, the mix of labels, and how you collected or created the dataset.

## Neural Network Implementation

### Neural Network Structure

TODO: Explain the structure of your neural network, including the input layer, hidden layer(s), and output layer. Justify your choices for the number of neurons in each layer.

### Forward Pass

TODO: Describe how you implemented the forward pass, including the weighted sum and activation function. Explain the logic behind your implementation.

### Backpropagation

TODO: Explain how you implemented the backpropagation algorithm to update weights and biases. Describe the role of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function in this process.

### Training Loop

TODO: Detail the training loop, including the number of iterations and how you monitored the learning process by printing the loss.

## Evaluation

### Model Accuracy

TODO: Describe the function you wrote to evaluate the model's accuracy on the dataset. Include the results of testing your network with new data points.

### Training Loss

TODO: Include a screenshot or log file showing the training loss over iterations. Discuss any patterns or observations you noticed.

## Code Explanation

TODO: Provide detailed explanations of the logic and reasoning behind each major section of your code (e.g., forward pass, backpropagation, training loop). Ensure that your code is well-commented to reflect these explanations.

## Challenges and Learning Experiences

TODO: Discuss the challenges you have encountered during the work on this assignment and describe the biggest learning takeaways.
